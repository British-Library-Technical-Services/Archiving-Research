### Summary

Some, but not all sound archives suggest an ultrasonic bath may be used to clean analog grooved media. IASA suggests ultrasonic cleaning may be effective.
  
Technical writing on ultrasonic cleaning shows that many variables exist in an ultrasonic bath that affect the cleaning action including power output, ultrasonic frequency, volume, gas content and temperature of liquid, concentrations of various solvents, surfactants and detergents. These variables also alter the risk of damage to items in a bath.

Manufacturers of baths marketed as ‘for the vinyl market’ make claims around their choice of power and frequency as most suitable for analog discs, but do not provide publicly available evidence for these claims, or their evidence is anecdotal. Enthusiasts and record collectors share wildly different opinions on ultrasonic cleaning and solvent formulations which have tended to be effective, but these claims are not supported by reliable data.

### Institutional Literature

#### IASA  (IASA-TC 04)

Ultrasonic cleaning is suggested and described. Cetrimide is suggested as a surfactant at 1% concentration in water.

>“5.2.3.7 Particularly dirty carriers, or those with stubborn marks such as dried-on paper deposits, may be more appropriately cleaned using an ultrasonic bath, into which the carrier (or portion of the carrier) is placed. The process works by vibrating a solution around the item, loosening dirt deposits.”

>“5.3.3.5 As with historical mechanical and other obsolete formats (see 5.2.3 Cleaning and Carrier Restoration), ultrasonic cleaning may be effective. Care should be taken in the selection of solvent, though a 1 per cent solution of Cetrimide in distilled water is an appropriate cleaning solution. The label should be kept clear of the fluid, and the disc rotated slowly until the whole groove area has been wetted.”

#### National Film and Sound Archive of Australia

Heat and frequency are mentioned in their description of ultrasonic cleaning of film.

>“Ultrasonic cleaners are efficient at removing a low level of dirt, oil and grease. The film is transported through a tank of slightly heated solvent. Ultrasonic transducers are fitted to the outside of the tank and pulse sound waves at 20 KHz through the tank.”

#### ARSC

From “ARSC Guide to Audio Preservation”. Details on cleaning specific types of grooved discs are included in this guide, so it follows that this is a recommendation for vinyl discs specifically.

> “Ultrasonic machines such as those made by Audio Desk or KLAUDIO may be an option for vinyl discs.”

#### Library of Congress

2006 Publication “Capturing Analog Sound for Digital Preservation: Report of a Roundtable Discussion of Best Practices for Transferring Analog Discs and Tapes” Does not mention ultrasonic cleaning as an option.

#### Swiss National Sound Archives

 Images on their site show what looks like a bespoke setup to turn and brush multiple discs in an ultrasonic bath.

“Two Keith Monks devices are available for the brush washing of single discs and an ultrasonic device for the simultaneous treatment of several discs together.”

### Academic Literature
#### Handbook for Critical Cleaning: Cleaning agents and systems
##### Kanegsberg, B. and Kanegsberg, E., 2017
 Discusses the importance of controlling cavitation energy in cleaning applications.

>“In almost all cleaning applications, it is important to control the cavitation energy. When an insufficient amount of cavitation energy is provided, undesirably long process times may be required to obtain a desired level of cleaning, or in some cases, a desired level of surface cleaning may not be achievable. On the other hand, excessive cavitation energy near a substrate having delicate surfaces or components can cause substrate damage.”

#### Ultrasonics: Fundamentals, Technologies, and Applications

##### Ensminger, D., 2009

Discusses the importance of cleaning fluid volume and the effects of acoustic impedance on a cleaning load.

>“The operation of bottom-mounted transducers is affected by the depth of solvent in the tank and by the loading in the tank. When the resonance in the tank coincides with the resonance of the transducer, maximum agitation occurs (i.e., when the depth of the solvent is a multiple of half-wavelengths at the driven frequency). When the depth is an odd multiple of quarter-wavelengths, the reflected wave is 180° out of phase with the transmitted wave, and, in such case, maximum destructive interference occurs. When the tank is loaded in such a manner that the standing-wave pattern is destroyed, the depth of loading becomes less significant and the acoustic impedance of the load becomes, primarily, a function of the characteristic impedance of the fluid in the tank. The effective cleaning volume is, then, a function of the total energy that is converted to acoustic energy in the fluid.”

  

Discusses proper loading of cleaning items and suggests harm from strong cavitation energy to certain materials.

  

>“Soft-glass containers and thick thermoplastic materials should not be used in the presence of strong cavitation. The glass will fracture under such conditions. The plastic will be damaged and, perhaps, punctured by intense cavitation. The arrangement of parts in a cleaning bath should be such that all areas to be cleaned are accessible to the cavitation. If parts are acoustically shielded by other heavier parts, they should be rearranged or removed for cleaning at a later time. Large parts may have to be reoriented occasionally to obtain full coverage. The choice of frequency depends upon the size of parts that the unit is designed to clean. Low frequencies are less subject to scattering and losses due to loading than are high frequencies, whereas high frequencies produce a greater number of stress maxima in a given volume.”

  

Implies that cleaning fluid, in this case water, should be de-gassed before cleaning.

  

>“The solution in the tank to be evaluated consists of tap water, which has been aged for 12 h at room temperature or ultrasonically agitated for 30 min in order to stabilize the gas content of the liquid.”

  

Suggests three methods for evaluating cleaning activity in an ultrasonic tank.

  

>“A popular and simple method of evaluating the activity in ultrasonic cleaning tanks consists of immersing a strip of aluminum foil mounted on a wire frame in a vertical position in the tank. The evaluation is based either upon the amount of pitting and erosion that occurs within a specified duration of time or upon the time required to erode holes in the foil. The foil-erosion method provides a good indication of the distribution of the cavitation within the tank. However, there are problems associated with its use that prevent it from becoming a suitable standard. However, foils of the same brand may exhibit different degrees of hardness and toughness to cavitation erosion. Particles of the foil resulting from cavitation erosion contaminate the solvent and must be removed. Further, the method of mounting the foil on the wires and the wire sizes and types themselves may affect the formation of cavitation pits in the foil.”

  Describes use of an Emulsion Probe

>“Emulsion probes consist of two immiscible liquids. The cavitation activity is evaluated by the rate at which the liquids are emulsified. The probe may be a small plastic bag containing distilled water and a piece of absorbent material saturated with oil. Alternatively, the oil-saturated material may be immersed directly in the cleaning fluid. Although this method does not provide an absolute measurement of “cavitation activity,” it does provide a rapid and visual indication of the potential effectiveness of the cleaner.”

  Describes a low-cost measurement method that is gaining acceptance

>“None of the previously mentioned techniques is entirely acceptable to all manufacturers and consumers of ultrasonic cleaners. A method that is gaining acceptance, however, is based upon the removal of graphite stains from aluminum oxide blocks. The face of the block is coated with a dark layer of pencil-type graphite and located within the cleaning tank. The tank is filled with water and operated for a predetermined length of time. Then, the block is removed, allowed to dry, and, thereafter, compared with a set of blocks rated from 1 to 10 according to the amount of light reflected from the surfaces (i.e., according to the amount of graphite removed).”

  

Suggests that cleaning activity of a loaded bath is highly variable.

  

>“In spite of what has been discussed above, it should be noted, however, that current ultrasonic cleaners are not readily calibrated; their stated acoustic output is not, in general, accurate and the conditions in the tank, even without a load, tend to be variable. When the variations caused by the mass and geometry of the load, the surface conditions, and chemistry are included, further variability is observed when measurements are made. In addition, there are wild variations in local acoustic/cavitation power that are attributed to the effects caused by minute changes in positioning of samples and the arrangement of sample supports or baskets in the tank. All of these issues can result in highly variable local performance and power.”

  

#### Ultrasonic Cleaning of Artifacts: A Preliminary Consideration

Suggests that de-gassing of a cleaning liquid is essential for full cleaning action to take place.

  

>“Cavitation is inhibited by the presence of dissolved gases in the cleaning liquid. The gas is usually driven off by the beginning of treatment, full cleaning action cannot be expected until degassing is complete. A delay on this score may be anticipated unless a large supply of degass, or stagnant, water is at hand.”

#### ARSC Journal

  

The only mention of ultrasonic cleaning is from a Q&A article published in 1983:

  

>“Q: Does ultrasonic cleaning damage cylinders and discs?
A: My experiments show that this method can lead to internal structural damage.”

  

#### TESLA Electronics 16:1 (March 1983): “Ultrasonic Cleaning of Gramophone Records”

  

Abstract: The fine grooves of gramophone records get clogged easily with dirt which can be removed only with considerable difficulty. Numerous cleaning methods have been applied and many cleaning aids exist, none of them being perfect. Experiments aiming at perfect cleaning of gramophone record grooves by ultrasonic means are reported. (I’m working on getting access to this article)

### Independent Archives

#### George Blood (George Blood LP)

  

The George Blood team didn’t use an ultrasonic bath in The Great 78 Project, only Keith Monks’ machines, so they don’t have any opinions or data.

#### Adrian Tuddenham (Poppy Records)

  

They don’t use ultrasonic machines either, but Adrian did provide some observations which are also reflected in academic literature.

  

-   A very wide range of materials is used in records and these may react differently, or even catastrophically, to different cleaning solutions.
    
-   Ultrasonic treatment may dislodge particles from granular materials, such as "shellac" compounds, resulting in a rough surface.
    
-   Something like micro-filtration of the cleaning fluid, should be applied to ultrasonic cleaning baths to prevent a build-up of contamination which would dry as deposits on the record surface.
    

  
  
  
  

### Manufacturers Literature and Specs

#### Degritter

  

Claims 120kHz is an optimal frequency for cleaning vinyl records. Sweeping the frequency is supported in academic literature as being beneficial to cleaning action of non uniform surfaces. It isn’t clear where 120kHz lies on their frequency sweep. Active filtering is mentioned.

  

Water tank capacity: 1.4 L

‘Ultrasonic Cleaning’: 120kHz / 300W

  

>“A 120kHz frequency provides finer and more evenly distributed cleaning action than lower frequency systems. In fact, this technology at even higher frequencies is used to clean parts in the semiconductor industry, where surfaces need to be pure on a molecular level.

>Degritter uses a custom ultrasonic bath with a custom 300W ultrasonic amplifier that has been designed specifically for cleaning vinyl records. The cleaning bath has four ultrasonic transducers (emitters), two on both sides covering the whole record. Degritter also comes with Frequency Sweep feature, which provides better cavitation energy and power distribution. Degritter is the only cleaning solution on the market working at 120kHz and having the Frequency Sweep feature.”

  

>“Degritter record cleaning machines come with an active filtering solution. Active means that it removes small particles and dirt from the water during the ultrasonic cleaning process. Dirt washed off the record is filtered out of the ultrasonic cleaning bath and it won’t end up back on the record.”

#### KLaudio

The company claims that 200W would ‘normally damage’ a vinyl record, and provides evidence by way of showing that extended cleaning at this power does not remove vinyl particles from a disc: [https://klaudio.com/is-200w-safe-for-my-vinyl](https://klaudio.com/is-200w-safe-for-my-vinyl). They don’t however, provide frequency specifications or examples of 200W ultrasonic cleaning damaging a vinyl record in the way they describe.

  

>“Enjoy your vinyl records as if they were new again! Klaudio's KD-CLN-LP200 brings an unrivaled 200 Watts of ultrasonic cleaning power to your LP collection. Using patent-pending technology, the toughest grime and dust is easily removed without the risk of physical scrubbers or need for detergent. Drying is also handled safely with blowers. Simply fill with distilled water and insert your phonograph record-- the rest is automated.

>Ultrasonic transducers are placed perpendicular to both sides of the disc for maximum cleaning effect. Klaudio's technology allows powerful waves to remove debris without damaging the disc, and special dampening minimizes vibration and noise. The entire washing and drying process can be adjusted from 3 to 9 minutes. Cleaning status is conveniently displayed through an LED progress bar.”
